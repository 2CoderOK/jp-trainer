# Jazz Piano Trainer

This is a desktop application to make learning and practising scales, chords and modes easier.

You can use your midi keyboard to input notes.

The application uses mido, python-rtmidi, and pyqt6

This app was inspired by the app of the same name by 2CoderOK but I have totally rewritten the code and extended functionality far beyond the original.
