# ðŸŽ¹ JazzPianoTrainer â€” Now Supercharged as JazzPianoLab!

Iâ€™ve created a beefy new version of JazzPianoTrainer, now called **JazzPianoLab**!  
It's written in C++ and uses JUCE 8 audio framework.

JazzPianoLab is packed with powerful features for modern musicians and educators:

- **VST3 Virtual Instrument Support**
- **Advanced Chord Profile System**
- **Real-Time Chord Identification**
- **Built-in MIDI Recorder**
- *And much more!*

If youâ€™re looking for a next-level jazz piano training tool, check out [JazzPianoLab](https://jazzpianolab.app/s/4p7ZtR) for the latest updates, downloads and  resources.

Feel free to explore and share your feedback.  
Letâ€™s make jazz piano learning smarter and more fun together!

Jazz Piano Trainer 

This is a desktop application that might help you learn modes and chords ;)
You can use your midi keyboard to input notes.

The application is using midio, python-rtmidi, pygame and tkinter libraries.

Here you can watch a video on how this application was created: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCQai649s_Q
